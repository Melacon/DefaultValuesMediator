Each EndPoint instance has a role (e.g., working, protection, protected, hub, spoke, leaf, root, etc.) with respect to the FC function. The association of the FC to LTPs is made via EndPoints (essentially the ports of the FC) where each EndPoint (EP) of the FC has a role in the context of the FC. The traffic forwarding between the associated End PointsEPs of the FC depends upon the type of FC and may be associated with FCSwitch object instances. In cases where there is protection conveys the protecting role of the access to the FC.  The EP replaces the Protection Unit of a traditional protection model. It represents a protected (resilient/reliable) point or a protecting (unreliable working or protection) point.";
